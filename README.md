# 👋 Hi, I'm Tony Kwok

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building reliable, scalable, and production-grade ML systems and experimenting with applied AI in real-world products.

I love working at the intersection of research and engineering, from fine-tuning LLMs and building RAG pipelines to deploying end-to-end data science workflows on modern data platforms.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🤖 **Applied AI & ML Engineering**  
  Building systems for real-time personalisation, customer retention, and intelligent assistants using:
  - Contextual Bandits & RL
  - Deep Learning & Classical ML
  - Model monitoring and evaluation

- 📊 **End-to-End MLOps & Data Platforms**  
  Delivering scalable, production-ready pipelines using:
  - AWS (EMR, Athena, ECS, S3)
  - Databricks, MLFlow, Airflow
  - PySpark, Docker, Jenkins, New Relic

- 🛠️ **LLM & NLP Systems**  
  Experimenting with LLMs for RAG, fine-tuning, and agentic workflows using:
  - Hugging Face, LoRA, LangChain
  - Groq, Multimodal LLMs
  - Vision-Language models for clinical imaging
